1. If you don't have node installed on linux, type the following commands:

        sudo apt update

        sudo apt install nodejs
    
2. drag the "upload" folder into cmd, and install the node modules (I didn't push the node modules cause it took a lot of space):
    
        npm install --save
        
3. Then typing  

        npm run serve
        
    on cmd, it will show the localhost address, copy the link to browser to see the result
